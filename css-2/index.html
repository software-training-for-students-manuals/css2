      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <h2>Importance of layouts and responsive design</h2>
      <p>
        In the previous CSS guide, when working with elements such as images, we
        were able to apply properties that were very effective individually. But
        what about when we want to create a website using many images? This is
        where layouts and responsive design is important. To put it simply,
        layouts allow us to contain a bunch of elements, and format them so they
        all behave simarly. Combine this with responsive design (a design where
        the properties change based on the size of the browser window, eg. a
        website for mobile browsers), and it allows for a very versitile
        website.
      </p>

    <section class="topic">
      <h1>Basic Layout</h1>
      <h2>Position</h2>
      <p>
        When looking at a website, it is pretty obvious that every element has
        its own position on the screen. But what isn’t as clear is that every
        element can have one of many different “types” of positions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before delving into the different types of positions, it should be noted
        what <span class="type">top</span>, <span class="type">bottom</span>,
        <span class="type">left</span>, and <span class="type">right</span> do.
        Each property affects the position given their direction, by the
        specified amount. Something like
        <span class="type">top: 50px</span> would set the top edge of the
        element 50px <em>down</em> from its nearest positioned ancestor.
      </p>
      <div class="reference full-width">
        <pre><code>position: static</code></pre>
        <p>
          Without knowing that there are different types of positions, most
          would assume that every position is of
          <span class="type">static</span> type. And that is for good reason. It
          is by far the most common position value seen on a website, and it is
          also the default for every HTML element. A static position is when an
          element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document.
          The text you are reading right now is of type
          <span class="type">static</span>. It also should be noted that
          <span class="type">top</span>, <span class="type">bottom</span>,
          <span class="type">left</span>, and <span class="type">right</span> do
          not affect static elements, but do work on all other position types.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="reference full-width">
        <pre><code>position: relative</code></pre>
        <p>
          The next type of position is <span class="type">relative</span>.
          Relative elements are offset a given amount from their normal
          position, but the offset does not affect other elements. For example,
          applying <span class="type">top: 50px</span>, will position the
          element 50px from the top edge (aka 50px down) of its nearest
          positioned ancestor. But, it will not offset its surrounding elements.
          The element of focus is offset relative to itself.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="reference full-width">
        <pre><code>position: absolute</code></pre>
        <p>
          Both <span class="type">relative</span> and
          <span class="type">static</span> elements remain in the normal flow of
          the document, because the surrounding elements are aware of the
          elements position. On the other hand, items of type
          <span class="type">absolute</span> are taken out of the flow. The
          surrounding elements of an absolutely positioned element act as if it
          does not exist. Applying top and left to an absolutely positioned
          element will be positioned down and right relative to its nearest
          non-static ancestor.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="reference full-width">
        <pre><code>position: fixed</code></pre>
        <p>
          Like <span class="type">absolute</span> positioning,
          <span class="type">fixed</span> elements are also removed from the
          normal flow of the document. The difference is, that instead of being
          positioned by its ancestor, it is positioned relative to the initial
          containing block established by the viewport. So the dimensions will
          change based on the browser size. Applying top and left would position
          the element down and right
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="reference full-width">
        <pre><code>position: sticky</code></pre>
        <p>
          The <span class="type">sticky</span> value for positioning can be
          thought of as a hybrid of <span class="type">relative</span> and
          <span class="type">fixed</span> positioning. This kind of element will
          be treated as a relative element while it remains in the viewport
          (browser screen), but once it reaches a certain threshold when
          scrolling away, it will become a fixed element. For example, applying
          <span class="type">top: 50px</span>
          will make the element 50px from the top edge, but once the user
          scrolls enough where the sticky element would be less than 50px from
          the top of the screen, it becomes fixed and sticks to the top.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>Display</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to different types of positions, each element also has
        different ways they can be displayed. And to do this, we can use the
        display property in order to specify the display behavior.
      </p>
      <div class="reference full-width">
        <pre><code>display: block</code></pre>
        <p>
          A <span class="type">block</span> level element will always start on a
          new line and it will take up the full available width (stretches
          horizontally as much as it can). For an example, if you have a
          bordered text box that is a block-level element, it will of course be
          on a new line, and even if the text inside does not take up the whole
          width, the textbox will stretch horizontally as much as it can.
          Visually, the border will surround the text and whitespace after the
          text. Here are some block-level elements that should be familiar:
          <span class="type">&ltdiv&gt</span>,
          <span class="type">&lth1&gt</span>, <span class="type">&ltp&gt</span>,
          <span class="type">&ltform&gt</span>,
          <span class="type">&ltheader&gt</span>,
          <span class="type">&ltfooter&gt</span>, and
          <span class="type">&ltsection&gt</span>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="reference full-width">
        <pre><code>display: inline</code></pre>
        <p>
          An <span class="type">inline</span> element is the opposite of a block
          element. It does not start on a new line, and it only takes as much
          width as necessary. Using the bordered text box example, the text
          inside an inline element will only take as much width as it needs, and
          the border will not contain any unnecessary white space. Here are some
          inline elements that should be familiar:
          <span class="type">&ltspan&gt</span>,
          <span class="type">&lta&gt</span>, and
          <span class="type">&ltimg&gt</span>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="reference full-width">
        <pre><code>display: inline-block</code></pre>
        <p>
          As one may expect, <span class="type">inline-block</span> is a
          combination of both <span class="type">inline</span> and
          <span class="type">block</span>. The difference between inline-block
          and inline is that you are able to set the top and bottom
          margins/paddings, width, and height to an element with inline-block.
          With inline, all of these properties are ignored, because recall that
          it only uses as much as space needed. The difference from block is
          that inline-block elements do not cause line breaks, so you can have
          multiple elements next to each other on the same line.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        That was a brief overview of the basic layout properties in CSS. When
        making a website, these properties can be very useful when you want to
        position a few elements a certain way, but when working with a lot of
        elements, it is more efficient to use the advanced layouts which we will
        go over next.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="topic">
      <h1>Flexbox</h1>
      <p>
        The first advanced layout model we will go over is flexbox. Flexbox is a
        powerful one-dimensional layout model that allows for space distribution
        between items in an interface and powerful alignment capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before getting into the flexbox properties, it is important to know that
        some properties are for flex containers and some are for flex items. As
        a refresher, a container is something like the
        <span class="type">&ltdiv&gt</span> tag where it doesn’t have any
        immediate effect visually, but it allows you to put other items inside
        of it. So, the idea of flexbox is to have a flex container consisting of
        many flex items. Properties on the container will have an effect on all
        of the items as a whole, while properties on an item will change the
        specified item individually.
      </p>
      <h2>Container</h2>
      <p>
        The following properties will be pertaining to the flex container rather
        than flex items.
      </p>
      <div class="reference full-width">
        <pre><code>display: flex</code></pre>
        <p>
          The <span class="type">flex</span> property simply enables flex
          content for the container, and all of its direct children. Without
          doing this first, using the flex properties we will learn later will
          have no effect on the layout.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="reference full-width">
        <pre><code>flex-direction: &ltvalue&gt</code></pre>
        <p>
          The <span class="type">flex-direction</span> property is the most
          fundamental part of flexbox, and it is really important to understand
          how it works. And luckily, it is very easy! Flex-direction establishes
          the main axis, or in other words, the direction that flex items are
          placed in the container. Flexbox, again, is a one-dimensional layout
          model, so there has to be a primary direction that the items will
          have.
        </p>
        <p>It can take the following values:</p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td><span class="highlight">row</span></td>
            <td>Items are placed from left to right</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>row-reverse</td>
            <td>Items are placed from right to left</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>column</td>
            <td>Items are placed from top to bottom</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>column-reverse</td>
            <td>Items are placed from bottom to top</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p class="center-text">
          <span class="highlight">Highlight</span> denotes default value
        </p>
        <img
          src="images/flex-direction.png"
          alt="Visual example of flex-direction"
        />
      </div>
      <div class="reference full-width">
        <pre><code>flex-wrap: &ltvalue&gt</code></pre>
        <p>
          If you know how text-wrapping works,
          <span class="type">flex-wrap</span> is the same idea. But for those
          who don’t, <span class="type">flex-wrap</span> defines how the flex
          items behave when there are too many items on one line.
        </p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td><span class="highlight">nowrap</span></td>
            <td>
              All of the flex items will try to fit on one line, even if it has
              to squish them
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>wrap</td>
            <td>
              When there is not enough room for the next flex item, it will
              start a new line and continue placing the flex items as so
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>wrap-reverse</td>
            <td>
              Same idea as wrap, but it will create a new line on top of the
              current one, so that the items will wrap in the reverse order
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p class="center-text">
          <span class="highlight">Highlight</span> denotes default value
        </p>
        <img src="images/flex-wrap.png" alt="Visual example of flex-wrap" />
      </div>
      <div class="reference full-width">
        <pre><code>flex-flow: [direction] [wrap]</code></pre>
        <p>
          The <span class="type">flex-flow</span> property is simply a shorthand
          for flex-direction and flex-wrap. So for an example, instead of doing
          flex-direction: column and flex-wrap: wrap, it can be reduced to
          flex-flow: column wrap. The default value for flex-flow is
          <span class="type">row nowrap</span>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <ol class="instruction-list">
        <li>
          We will first work with <span class="type">index.html</span>, so open
          it in any browser

        <li>
          Open <span class="type">masonry.css</span> in a text editor of your
          choice, and we will be adding to the
          <span class="type">.image-grid</span> class
          <pre><code>.image-grid {
  max-height: 800px;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}</code></pre>
          Remember that <span class="type">flex-flow</span> is a shorthand for
          <span class="type">flex-direction</span> and
          <span class="type">flex-wrap</span>, so try condensing the code!
        </li>

          Your pictures should now be formatted similarly to this:

            src="images/masonry-example-1.png"
            alt="Picture of website after adding flexbox properties stated above"
          />
          Note that the space between images will vary per person (for now).
        </li>
      </ol>
      <div class="reference full-width">
        <pre><code>justify-content: &ltvalue&gt</code></pre>
        <p>
          We stated before that flex-direction is very important in
          understanding flexbox, and properties like
          <span class="type">justify-content</span> is the reason why.
          Justify-content defines the alignment along the main axis (defined by
          flex-direction) and determines the behavior when there is leftover
          space. There are many values for this property, but we will only be
          going over the most common ones. We do encourage you to check out the
          flexbox documentation to see all of the properties.
        </p>

      <div class="reference full-width">
        <pre><code>align-items: &ltvalue&gt</code></pre>
        <p>
          The <span class="type">justify-content</span> property defines how
          items are laid out along the main axis defined by flex-direction. So
          we can think of align-items as justify-content, but perpendicular to
          the main-axis (known as the cross-axis). Again, we are only going over
          the most common values, but if you are interested in knowing all of
          them, strongly encourage reading the documents (which can be found

      <h2>Item</h2>
      <p>
        The following properties are now pertaining to flex items rather than
        the container.
      </p>
      <div class="reference full-width">
        <pre><code>order: [num]</code></pre>
        <p>
          Flex items are laid out in the source order by default, but using the
          <span class="type">order</span> property, you can manually change the
          order in how they appear. It is important to note that the default
          order is 0, so setting one flex item to order: 1 will make it the last
          item because the rest of the orders are of value 0. To make it the
          first item, you can either do something like order: -1, or by manually
          putting in the order for the rest of the items.
        </p>
        <img src="images/flex-order.png" alt="Visual example of flex-order" />
      </div>
      <div class="reference full-width">
        <pre><code>flex-grow: [num]</code></pre>
        <p>
          The property <span class="type">flex-grow</span> defines the ability
          for a flex item to grow if needed. It takes a non-negative number that
          serves as a proportion, which dictates how much of the available space
          inside the flex container the item should take up. The default value
          is 0, so if you only define flex-grow for one item, since the other
          items have a value of 0, that item will take as much space as it can.
          Another example is that if all flex items have a value of 1 result in
          the remaining space being distributed evenly. But if one is changed to
          2, then that item will try to take twice as much space compared to the
          others.
        </p>
        <img src="images/flex-grow.png" alt="Visual example of flex-grow" />
      </div>
      <div class="reference full-width">
        <pre><code>flex-shrink: [num]</code></pre>
        <p>
          The <span class="type">flex-shrink</span> is identical to flex-grow,
          but instead affects how the item shrinks if needed.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="reference full-width">
        <pre><code>flex-basis: auto | [length]</code></pre>
        <p>
          The <span class="type">flex-basis</span> property sets the default
          size of an element before the remaining space can be distributed. The
          default value is auto, which means to refer to the width or height
          property. Otherwise, you can set the default size to a length value
          (%, em, etc.). It should be noted that if set to 0, the extra space
          around the content is not factored, while if it is set to auto, then
          the distributed space is based on the flex-grow value.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="reference full-width">
        <pre><code>flex: grow (shrink) (basis)</code></pre>
        <p>
          The <span class="type">flex</span> property is a shorthand for
          flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis. If given one value, it sets
          the value for flex-grow, while flex-shrink and flex-basis are set to
          their default value. If given two values, then the first value is set
          to flex-grow, and if the second value is a number, then it is assigned
          to flex-shrink, while if it is a width, it is assigned to flex-basis.
          And if given three values, it is assigned to flex-grow, flex-shrink,
          and flex-basis respectively.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="reference full-width">
        <pre><code>align-self: auto | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | stretch</code></pre>
        <p>
          The <span class="type">align-self</span> property allows for an
          individual flex item to have a specific alignment. Align-self will
          override the default alignment (or the alignment from align-items).
          The values for this property are identical to the ones from
          <em>align-items</em>, but instead it only affects one item.

      <h1>Grid</h1>
      <p>
        The second advanced layout model we will go over is
        <span class="type">grid</span>. Grid, like flexbox, allows for powerful
        alignment and spacing capabilities, but it is a two-dimensional system.
        If you remember from flexbox, everything we did before was based on a
        singular direction, but with grid, we will have control over both the
        rows and columns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recall that with flexbox, most properties are applied to a container
        (such as &ltdiv&gt), and the same applies for grid.
      </p>
      <h2>Container</h2>
      <p>
        The following properties will be pertaining to the grid container rather
        than grid items.
      </p>
      <div class="reference full-width">
        <pre><code>display: grid</code></pre>
        <p>
          This property defines its element as a grid container, allowing for
          other grid properties to be applied. Without defining the display
          property, the other flex properties will have no effect.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="reference full-width">
        <pre><code>grid-template-columns: [size] ...
grid-template-rows: [size] ...</code></pre>
        <p>
          These two properties,
          <span class="type">grid-template-columns</span> and
          <span class="type">grid-template-rows</span>, create the foundation of
          the grid layout. They define both the amount of rows/columns and the
          size. To do this, you simply list values, separated by spaces. Each
          value should specify the size of the row/column, and the number of
          space separated values denotes how many rows/columns are in the grid.
          To make it more clear, we will go over some examples.
        </p>
        <pre><code>grid-template-columns: 20px 30px auto 10px
grid-template-rows: 25% 35px</code></pre>
        <p class="center-text border">
          These properties result in a grid with 4 columns and 2 rows (2x4
          grid), with their respective track (row/column) sizes.
        </p>
        <pre><code>grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr</code></pre>
        <p class="center-text border">
          With the first example, it is likely that none of the units were
          unfamiliar, but the fr unit may be something you haven’t seen before.
          The fr unit sets the track size as a fraction relative to the free
          space left in the grid container. So with this example, each column is
          one fourth of the grid container width.
        </p>
        <pre><code>grid-template-columns: 1fr 50px 2fr 1fr</code></pre>
        <p class="center-text border">
          When using fr, the amount of free space is applied after non-flexible
          items. So, first column 2 will take up 50px, and now it will calculate
          the free space. The free space being the grid container width minus
          50px, and the first and fourth column each take one fourth of the free
          space, while the third column will take up half.
        </p>
        <p>
          It should also be noted that when creating a grid, names are assigned
          to the row and column lines. For an example, if we go back to the
          example where we created four columns, the columns are numbered from 1
          to 4 respectively. Each line also has an alternative name, where the
          last line is named -1, and continues to go further into the negative
          (fourth line numbered -1 and first is -4 in our example).
        </p>
        <p>
          Although there is an automatic naming convention, it can be useful to
          explicitly name the lines. This can be done by putting the name in
          brackets before the track size value. For an example:
        </p>
        <pre><code>grid-template-columns: [c1-start] 20px [c1-end c2-start] 30px [line3] auto [line4] 10px [line5]</code></pre>
        <p class="center-text border">
          A few things to note here: First being that there are five different
          brackets in a grid with four columns. This is because the names are
          tied to the lines, so there will always be one more line than a track.
          Second is that in [c1-end c2-start] it follows the standard html
          naming convention where you can have multiple names by separating the
          names with a space.
        </p>
        <p>
          Naming lines can be useful when needing to redefine the grid. Instead
          of needing to redefine the positions by changing the line number, by
          explicitly naming the line you will always know what the name refers
          to unless you decide to explicitly change it again. Many times though,
          the automated names are sufficient enough.
        </p>
      </div>
      <ol class="instruction-list">
        <li>
          We are first going to initialize the grid to have four columns using

        </li>
        <li>
          Note how the height is disproportionately large, and this is because
          we have not defined the size of the grid-rows. Now lets define a bunch
          of rows with a set size so that the images are formatted using
          <span class="type">grid-template-rows</span>.

          There is going to be a lot of extra space at the bottom, but that is
          okay! We will address this later.

      </ol>

      <div class="reference full-width">
        <pre><code>grid-template-areas: ... | ...</code></pre>
        <p>
          Using grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns is not the only way
          to define a grid template. The property
          <span class="type">grid-template-areas</span> defines a grid template
          by naming grid areas; Grid areas simply being a smaller grid inside of
          the template. There is a lot of flexibility when creating a template
          area, so we will go over an example to make it more clear.
        </p>
        <pre><code>grid-template-areas: 
  “head head head side”
  “main main .... side”
  “foot foot foot side”</code></pre>
        <p class="center-text border">
          It creates a grid with three rows and four columns, with each cell
          having their respective name. An empty cell is denoted by any number
          of periods, given there are no spaces between. Multiple periods are
          helpful to align the code how it looks visually
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="important">
        Another thing to note that each row needs to have the same number of
        cells, and that the names represent the areas. These names become useful
        when wanting to adjust specific areas, which we will go over in the grid
        item properties. If you want to reference the lines at the end of the
        areas, you can do this with area-name-start and area-name-end.
      </div>
      <div class="reference full-width">
        <pre><code>grid-template: none | &ltgrid-template-rows&gt / &ltgrid-template-columns&gt</code></pre>
        <p>
          If you were wondering if there is a shorthand for the previous
          grid-template properties we have gone over, this is it. The
          <span class="type">grid-template</span> property can combine both the
          template-rows and columns in one property, and even include
          grid-template-areas to have all three. Setting the value to none
          simply sets all three properties to their initial values, so nothing
          too interesting. Including both grid-template-rows and
          grid-template-columns, on the other hand, is a lot more useful. It is
          necessary to separate the rows and columns values with a forward
          slash, so be careful about that. Using all three properties is a
          little more complicated, so I will include an example to make it
          easier to understand.

  “main main side”</code></pre>

          By comparing the two blocks of code, you can see how grid-template
          cleverly includes all three properties into one.

          In the previous properties, we have gone over how to explicitly name
          grid lines, but now we will go over how to change how they look
          visually. Both the <span class="type">column-gap</span> and
          <span class="type">row-gap</span> property allows us to change the
          size of the respective lines. Of course, you cannot actually see the
          grid lines, but you will be able to see the spacing between the grid
          items. This property is useful when the items in the grid feel too
          cramped, and require some spacing. Note that this property only
          affects the gaps between the columns/rows. The outer edges (think
          margin) will not change with this property.

        <pre><code>gap: &ltrow-gap&gt &ltcolumn-gap&gt</code></pre>
        <p>
          It would only make sense to have a shorthand property for column-gap
          and row-gap. The <span class="type">gap</span> property achieves this
          by making this into one line with a space separation. If only one
          value is specified, both row and column are set to that value.

          Remember that <span class="type">gap</span> is a shorthand for

      <p class="good-to-know">
        The old version of the gap property required a prefix of grid (Ex.
        grid-column-gap). And while most browsers allow you to omit the prefix,
        there is a chance that you may run into a situation where it is
        required.

          You were probably expecting another shorthand after we introduced
          justify-content and align-content, and you would be correct. We can
          use the <span class="type">place-content</span> property to set both
          properties at once by separating them with a forward slash. And again,
          if only one value is given, it is applied to both align and justify.

          We now want to horizontally align our images while keeping them at the

  column-gap: 20px;

        <pre><code>grid-auto-columns: &lttrack-size&gt
grid-auto-rows: &lttrack-size&gt</code></pre>
        <p>
          As the name suggests, the
          <span class="type">grid-auto-columns</span> and
          <span class="type">grid-auto-rows</span> property sets the size of
          auto generated tracks. To give some insight on how auto tracks are
          made, we will later go over a grid item property which can specify
          what row/column it spans on. If that specified cell is out of the
          range made from the grid-template, then auto generated tracks are
          created. For an example, if we have a template of a 2x2 grid, but we
          set an item to be in row 2, column 4, two extra columns will be
          created. The fourth column’s size will automatically be set depending
          on the grid item, but what happens to the third column? It actually
          has a width of 0 by default, so visually it does not even appear to
          exist. With these properties we are able to change that 0 value into a
          value we specify.

          We are finally going to fix the extra space! We can do this by

          and replacing it with <span class="type">grid-auto-rows</span>. This
          way, regardless of how many images we have, CSS will always know to
          keep making rows of the desired size.

          feature about grid is that you can explicitly set the location of an

          And if the location is not explicitly set, the grid-auto-flow property

        <p>
          The <span class="type">grid</span> property is an extremely useful
          shorthand which combines grid-template-rows, grid-template-columns,
          grid-template-areas, grid-auto-rows, grid-auto-columns, and
          grid-auto-flow in one property. Note that you have to choose either
          explicit or implicit grid properties in a single declaration. Although
          it is very useful, we will not be going over it just because it takes
          a bit to get used to, and there is a lot of other material to go over.
          So I would highly encourage to look at the css documentations for more
          information on the grid property.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>Item</h2>
      <p>
        The following properties are now pertaining to grid items rather than
        the container.
      </p>
      <div class="reference full-width">
        <pre><code>grid-column-start: &ltvalue&gt
grid-column-end: &ltvalue&gt
grid-row-start: &ltvalue&gt
grid-row-end: &ltvalue&gt</code></pre>
        <p>
          With these properties, we are able to explicitly define where the grid
          item is placed. The <span class="type">grid-column-start</span> and
          <span class="type">grid-row-start</span> property define what line
          where the item begins, while
          <span class="type">grid-column-end</span> and
          <span class="type">grid-row-end</span>
          define what line the item ends at. Extra emphasis that they are
          defined by the grid lines, so an item defined with grid-column-start:

          Recall that there were two ways to define a grid template,
          grid-template-areas and grid-template-rows/columns. So depending on
          how you set up your template (note that you can use both ways
          simultaneously), the way you use the
          <span class="type">grid-area</span> property may vary.

          We will now be working in <span class="type">image-pan</span>. This
          class is the first image in our grid, and it is named pan because it
          was orignally a panorama, but it has been clipped in order to fit in
          the cell. Now lets define this image to take up all four columns.
        </li>
        <li>
          In order to do this, we must first make a small change in our
          <span class="type">grid-image</span> class. Simply remove the
          <span class="type">max-width"</span> line. This property was here
          because the images are very large, so initially it would be a big
          cluster, but now it is not needed since we have defined our grid.
          <pre><code>.grid-image {
  /* removed max-width */
  max-height: 200px;
  object-fit: cover;
}</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          Now we can define the location of <span class="type">image-pan</span>
          <pre><code>.image-pan {
  grid-column: 1 / span 4;
  grid-row: 7 / 8;
}</code></pre>
          Try using the <span class="type">grid-area</span> property!
        </li>

          Our website should now look like this:

      <pre><code>.image-grid {
  /* setting up grid container */
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 20px;
  /* removed border */
  width: 1300px; /* increase width if the grid is too small! */
}</code></pre>
      <p>And now the website is finished!</p>
